# House Price Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting house prices accurately based on various features like location, size, and amenities using Python.

---

## Overview

This project implements a regression-based machine learning model to predict housing prices from real estate data. It leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and powerful regression algorithms to provide reliable and interpretable price estimates. Ideal for demonstrating practical skills in data science and machine learning applied to real-world problems.

## Features

- Clean and preprocess raw housing data for modeling
- Visualize key data distributions and relationships with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Build and train regression models (e.g., XGBoost) for price prediction
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared and MAE
- Easily extendable for other datasets and features

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost for machine learning models
